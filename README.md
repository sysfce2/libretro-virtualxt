VirtualXT is a Turbo PC/XT emulator for [libretro](https://www.libretro.com) that runs on modern hardware, operating systems and bare-metal ARM SBCs.
It is designed to be simple and lightweight yet still capable enough to run a large library of old application and games.

Browser version is avalible [here](https://app.virtualxt.org).

## Features

* PC/XT chipset
* CGA or VGA compatible graphics

## Build

The emulator is written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) and can be compiled using the included GNU Makefile.

```
git clone https://github.com/virtualxt/virtualxt
cd virtualxt
make
# Or if you have RetroArch installed.
make run
```

You can download pre-built binaries from [itch.io](https://phix.itch.io/virtualxt/purchase).

## ISA Passthrough​

VirtualXT (v1.2) supports ISA passthrough using Arstech [USB2ISA](https://arstech.com/install/ecom-catshow/usb2.0.html) adapter or the [CH367](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003569540792.html) development board.
It should be noted that DMA currently not supported and the CH367 board is **VERY** limited in it's capabilities.

## Hardware Validation

A hardware validator was developed to ensure proper CPU behaviour.
Some additional information about that can be found [here](https://hackaday.io/project/184209-virtualxt-hardware-validator).
This [talk](https://youtu.be/qatzd0niz9A?si=_NVqQu_zc1KDB8W6) by Daniel Balsom describes the process in details.
